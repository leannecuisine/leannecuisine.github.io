I am on Annals of Health Law & Life Sciences, Loyola's health law journal.
I am also on the law podcast The Podvocate, for which I have produced and recorded several interviews with help from my colleagues.
I was a student TA and facilitator for the Professional Identity Formation course, a mandatory first-year law course.
I am Social Chair and Secretary for the Asian Pacific American Law Students Association (APALSA), where I help to organize events, write weekly newsletters, and serve as the point of contact for our membership and the Executive Board.
I am a volunteer with the Health Justice Project, where I currently help to organize data and research residences negatively impacted by city nuisance ordinances.
